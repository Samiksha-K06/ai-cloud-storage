AI (Artificial Intelligence)

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that focuses on making machines think, learn, and act like humans.

💡 In simple terms:

AI means creating computer programs that can:

Learn from experience (like humans do)

Understand language, images, or sound

Make decisions or solve problems

Improve over time without being explicitly reprogrammed

🧠 Main Types of AI

Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Designed for one specific task

Examples: Siri, Google Assistant, ChatGPT, Netflix recommendations

General AI (Strong AI)

Would have human-like intelligence across any task

Example: Still theoretical — doesn’t exist yet

⚙️ How AI Works

AI systems use a combination of:

Data → lots of examples or information

Algorithms → rules and mathematical models

Training → improving the model by learning patterns in data

This is similar to how humans learn from experience.

🤖 Branches of AI

Machine Learning (ML) – learning from data automatically

Deep Learning (DL) – uses neural networks like the human brain

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – understanding human language (like ChatGPT!)

Computer Vision – recognizing images or videos

Robotics – using AI to control machines or robots

💬 Examples in Daily Life
